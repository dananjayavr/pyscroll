pyscroll - The CS Search Engine

pyscroll is a short program written in Python which is aimed at helping Computer Science
students or for anyone who is interested in learning Computer Science. 

pyscroll employs a custom Google search which will find lecture slides, assignments, questions,
answers, etc. realted to CS that are hosted mainly in University websites. I'm using Google 
Custom Search API here to scrape through those areas to find resources related to the 
search terms you have provided.

For example:

$ python pyscroll python tutorials

That will return 10 results, which will contain resources realted to Python programming.
Then you can either download them (if the link is a .pdf or .ppt or etc.) or view them through
your default web browser.

To use pyscroll, you need a Python interpreter version 2.X and also google-api-python-client,
which can be downloaded and installed from here;

http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/

for free. It's very easy to install the module. Just look at the instructions

http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/wiki/Installation

here.


After you satisfied all the dependencies, just download pyscroll and execute it.
Make sure to supply the search terms you want via command line argument. Like this:

$ python pyscroll <search term>
